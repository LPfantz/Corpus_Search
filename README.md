# Corpus_Search

This is project I made for Grady Kepler. It takes in a corpus of articles (Formatted like the NOW Corpus: https://www.english-corpora.org/now/), filters for date and news source, performs a word search, and then filters out duplicate articles as detirmined by how many sentences articles have in common.
